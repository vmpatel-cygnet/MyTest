Introduction
============

The iVvy system is built with flexibility in mind, and this API forms a large
part of that promise.

The API described in this document follows an RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
paradigm. Each RPC method is grouped into a few higher level namespaces to help
organise this document in a more logical manner.

iVvy takes security very seriously and the API described in this document has
been designed to be as secure as possible.

-   All transport has been secured by utilising industry standard TLS

-   Key generation can be done first authenticating with the iVvy backend system

-   All requests must be signed using the key/secret pair to prove the request
    was made by a valid key

-   All requests have a time limit to avoid future replay attacks

Obtaining Keys
==============

Keys are defined as a pair of strings, the ‘key’ and the ‘secret’. Each request
must be signed using a ‘secret’ key. There are generated from within the
accounts ‘settings’ section of the website.

Creating the request
====================

Requests to the API are over the standard HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
The protocol defines three parts to every request

1.  the method/uri header

2.  a number of request headers

3.  optional body of the request

Note also that the HTTP request also needs to be secured by a TLS/SSL
connection, often referred to as HTTPS (or HTTP over SSL). iVvy uses industry
standard TLS (Transport Layer Security, the successor to SSL, Secure Sockets
Layer) to secure the HTTP transport to the API to ensure eavesdropping on the
connection by third parties is protected.

Method/URI Header
-----------------

This is a line consisting of the method of the request, followed by the request
URI, followed by the HTTP version. i.e.

>   POST /api/1.0/event?action=getEventList HTTP/1.0

This example is for a request, to iVvy’s api ‘event’ namespace, calling the
‘getEventList’ API call, using HTTP version 1.0. Note the HTTP method for calls
to the iVvy API are all POST requests. The api version being called is 1.0.
Currently supported versions are:

-   1.0

The URI in the request must always start with /api/{version} (where {version} is
the specific api version, e.g. 1.0) followed by the namespace of the eventual
api call to make. All requests must also provide the action parameter indicating
the API call to invoke.

Request Headers
---------------

Request headers are defined by the header name, followed by a colon (:) followed
by a space, followed by the value of the header. A number of headers are used
with the iVvy API
